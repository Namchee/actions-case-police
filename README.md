# Actions Case Police

ðŸš¨ Use the correct case, even on GitHub issues. Directly inspired by the original [case-police](https://github.com/antfu/case-police).

## Installation

> To use `actions-case-police`, you'll need to prepare a GitHub access token. Please refer to this [article](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) on how to generate an access token.

You can integrate `actions-case-police` to your existing GitHub actions workflow by using `Namchee/actions-case-police@<version>` in one of your jobs using `yaml`.

Below is the example of using `actions-case-police` job in your action workflow.

```
on:
  pull_request:
  issues:

jobs:
  case-police:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Use the correct case
        uses: Namchee/actions-case-police@v(version)
        with:
          access_token: <YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE>
          fix         : true
```

Please refer to [GitHub workflow syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#about-yaml-syntax-for-workflows) for more advanced usage.

> ðŸ’¡ You can use a special syntax `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` as your access token and the `github-actions` bot will run the job on behalf of you.
